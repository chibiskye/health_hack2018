		<h1> Why Should "We" College Students Eat Healthy </h1>
		
		<p class="abstract">
		We, <text style="text-decoration:line-through">the people</text> the college students, spend
		most of our time running all over our college campuses, following busy schedules crammed to the
		brim with science, mathematics, history, arts-- and let's not forget good old English course (don't 
		be tricked by the fancy wording in "literature"). It's no surprise that we barely even have time to 
		worry about our well-being. I mean, come on, there's two midterms tomorrow and you haven't even started
		studying for either of them yet, no thanks to the research paper you had to work on that was due yesterday
		and the huge project whose deadline is in 2 days. AGHHHHHHH!!!

		<button id="btn_swirly_eyes" onclick="stop()">
		Getting dizzy? Click here to stop spinning.
		</button>
		
		<p class="abstract">
		Okay, okay, we get the point, we're busy-- but we shouldn't be so busy that we don't have time to eat a 
		proper meal. In fact, not eating a proper meal can harm you more than benefit you, and not just any meal--
		a health, nutritious meal. Don't have time to eat a proper meal? Taking a minute to grab a healthy snack
		or two won't jeopardize your grade. On the contrast, it might be just the thing you need to finally figure
		out the answer to that last question you were stuck on for over an hour.
