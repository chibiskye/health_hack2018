		<h1> Why Should "We" College Students Eat Healthy </h1>
		
		<p class="abstract">
		We, <text style="text-decoration:line-through">the people</text> the college students, spend
		most of our time running all over our college campuses, following busy schedules crammed to the
		brim with science, mathematics, history, arts-- and let's not forget good old English course (don't 
		be tricked by the fancy wording in "literature"). It's no surprise that we barely even have time to 
		worry about our well-being. I mean, come on, there's two midterms tomorrow and you haven't even started
		studying for either of them yet, no thanks to the research paper you had to work on that was due yesterday
		and the huge project whose deadline is in 2 days; (takes a deep breath) Phew, try saying all that in one
		breath.
